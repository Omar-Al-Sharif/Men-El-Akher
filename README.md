This repository contains the code and resources for our participation in the AIC-1 AI competition, organized by The Military Technical College and The Applied Innovation Center (AIC) of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology in Egypt. The competition aims to develop a Modern Standard AI model that can understand and summarize Arabic text.

## Team: Al Qalam

Our team, "Al Qalam," is named after the 4th ayah revealed in the Quran:

"الَّذِي عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ"

Team Members:
- Omar Adel
- Omar Atef
- Omar Badr
- Youssef Hany

## About the Competition

The AIC-1 competition presents an exciting challenge in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Neural Networks. We are tasked with developing an AI model that can effectively comprehend Arabic text and generate accurate summaries.


## Evaluation Metrics

Our model will be evaluated based on the following metrics:

- rouge1
- rouge2
- rougeL
- Expert evaluations

We are committed to optimizing our model's performance based on these metrics to achieve the best results.

## Repository Structure

```
- /data: Contains the dataset of Arabic articles used for training and evaluation.
- /models: Includes the trained AI model and any related files.
- /code: Contains the source code for our AI model development and evaluation.
- /resources: Includes additional resources, documentation, and references.
```
