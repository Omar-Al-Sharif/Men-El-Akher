## About the Competition 🏆

The AIC-1 competition presents an exciting challenge in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and transformers. We are tasked with developing an AI model that can effectively comprehend Arabic text and generate accurate summaries.


## Evaluation Metrics 📏

Our model is evaluated based on the following metrics:

- rouge1
- rouge2
- rougeL
- Expert evaluations

We are committed to optimizing our model's performance based on these metrics to achieve the best results.

## Repository Structure 💻

```
- /data: Contains the dataset of Arabic articles used for training and evaluation.
- /models: Includes the trained AI model and any related files.
- /code: Contains the source code for our AI model development and evaluation.
```
